I have a number of ongoing personal projects, and while many are for the purposes of learning, and others for utility, I often find myself sitting back and considering if they’re worth the effort. Why am I working on these? Why am I building this shit, or hobbling together moving parts to boot up a POC?

These questions often arise when I’m deciding on a project to dive in to during a block of time I’ve carved out for that very purpose. There are a million other things I could be doing, but I’m hardening a Compose file instead. Or I’m drafting an Actions workflow. Or I’m learning how to build my own Linux distro. None of this is making me any money, and I’m not out there applying for jobs in which to showcase my work. Everything I have on my GitHub is for my personal enrichment.

I believe this in itself is a worthy endeavor. Learning for the sake of learning is a powerful means to hone the mind. Also, the act of creation is an impulse no person can ignore for long without feeling its effects on one’s spirit. The simple reality is not everything must be done for profit; we are allowed to enjoy doing things for the sake of doing them.

In this hyper-productive world, however, this seems like such a foreign concept. The construct of hyper-productivity permeates almost everything around me. If it’s not being done for some clear personal profit or social benefit, why is it being done at all? I remember an ad coming on prior to a YouTube video I wanted to watch where some guy was spitting the idea you should be monetizing your hobbies. Gone are the days of doing anything for fun. If you find you’re good at something, monetize it. Monetize your hobbies, monetize your family, hell, monetize your bodily fluids. If it can be done, do it for profit.

Money is the only thing that matters, and so we forego the pleasure of creation for the purpose of monetization. You like playing video games? Great. Stream it. Create a schedule and be consistent. Create graphics. Spend as much time promoting your streams as you actually stream, if not more. Build a website. Setup subscription tiers. Boot up a Discord server. Engage engage engage. Remember, this is a job now. Don’t slack off or you won’t make as much money playing video games on stream as you otherwise would if you devoted yourself fully to it.

Think about how insane that sounds! All I want to do is merc some bullymongs on Pandora in search of some great loot and bullshit with friends while doing it. But nope! Can’t talk, can’t hang, gotta get these stickers out, make these gifs, clip these vids in prep for my social media marketing blitz starting tomorrow. Have a beer for me! How exhausting to live in such a world.

The ironic part of this is many of the projects, if not all of them, provide some utility, are useful in some way, outside of the learning opportunities provided by building them. Why am I developing some of this shit? Because at some point, I recognized a personal use case or exploratory opportunity. These projects aren’t entirely useless. And yet, because I’m not getting paid by the hour to work on them leaves me wondering why I’m working on them at all, and that’s the problem. I shouldn’t have to rationalize my efforts to create something, to build, to learn, to explore for pleasure, especially with myself.

While I don’t often come to this place of consideration, the fact that it arises is problematic enough. It speaks to an insidious undercurrent in our social fabric of firmly placing the value of a human on their ability to produce and nowhere else. We are so much more than our productivity.

Anyway, I drafted a roadmap for how I can utilize some of the things I’m working on upon their completion, and this staved that feeling for a bit. I would, however, love to work on my shit without feeling like I’m wasting my time, because I’m not.
